CBM-PLA  PCB by Steve Gray, 2021-06-07
=======

This is a copy of the design at:
http://www.vic20.de/html/eprom_pla_8296_und_c64.html

I have duplicated it in Kicad.
The routing was slightly changed to allow for a smaller pcb.

This PCB uses a 27512 EPROM or compatible EEPROM.

You must program the 27512 with the appropriate BIN file
for your needs:

* 8296 UE5 or UE6
* C64
* Plus/4, C16, C116 etc
* 1551 Disk drive
* more...

Be sure to solder the header and socket in the correct
location. 

GERBERS directory contains cbm-pla.zip which can be sent
to the board house.
